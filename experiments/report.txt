Experiment 001
==============
DE was tested using the following parameters
Schwefel 2.26 (Zhang and Sanderson, 2009) function14, nu=1, np=10, F=0.85, CR=0.5, kss=1 (see other parameters in depp_input/input_parameters.txt)
Goal: Take a benchmark for pure DE 
Number of repetitions: 50
Average g: 22
stdev g: 7
% of failures: 30
Results: results001.xls


Experiment 002
==============
DE was tested using the following parameters
Schwefel 2.26 (Zhang and Sanderson, 2009) function14, nu=1, np=10, F=0.85, CR=0.5, kss=1 (see other parameters in depp_input/input_parameters.txt)
Goal: Evaluate boundary constraints using resampling instead of projection
Number of repetitions: 50
Average g: 23
stdev g: 4
% of failures: 12
Results: results002.xls
Conclusion: it can be seen that resampling reduced the percentage of failures compared to projection (from 30% to 12%)


Experiment 003
==============
DE-RSM was tested using the following parameters
Schwefel 2.26 (Zhang and Sanderson, 2009) function14, nu=1, np=10, F=0.85, CR=0.5, kss=1, kh=2, fh=0.35, fnb=2 (see other parameters in depp_input/input_parameters.txt)
Goal: Register a benchmark of DE-RSM with fh=0.35
Number of repetitions: 50
Average g: 13
stdev g: 3
% of failures: 12
Results: results003.xls
Conclusion: it can be seen that the number of generations reduced 44% compared with the Experiment 002.


Experiment 004
==============
DE-RSM was tested using the following parameters
Schwefel 2.26 (Zhang and Sanderson, 2009) function14, nu=1, np=10, F=0.85, CR=0.5, kss=1, kh=2, fh=0.5, fnb=2 (see other parameters in depp_input/input_parameters.txt)
Goal: Register a benchmark of DE-RSM with fh=0.5
Number of repetitions: 50
Average g: 12
stdev g: 3
% of failures: 8 
Results: results004.xls
Conclusion: The performance of Experiment004 and Experiment003 are similar.


Experiment 005
==============
DE-RSM was tested using the following parameters
Schwefel 2.26 (Zhang and Sanderson, 2009) function14, nu=1, np=10, F=0.85, CR=0.5, kss=1, kh=2, fh=0.75, fnb=2 (see other parameters in depp_input/input_parameters.txt)
Goal: Register a benchmark of DE-RSM with fh=0.75
Number of repetitions: 50
Average g: 11
stdev g: 3
% of failures: 10  
Results: results005.xls
Conclusion: The performance of Experiment005, Experiment004 and Experiment003 are similar.
