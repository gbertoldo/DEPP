DE was tested using the following parameters
Schwefel 2.26 (Zhang and Sanderson, 2009) function14, nu=1, np=10, F=0.85, CR=0.5, kss=1 (see other parameters in depp_input/input_parameters.txt)
Goal: Take a benchmark for pure DE 
Number of repetitions: 50
Average g: 22
stdev g: 7
% of failures: 30
Results: results001.xls



DE was tested using the following parameters
Schwefel 2.26 (Zhang and Sanderson, 2009) function14, nu=1, np=10, F=0.85, CR=0.5, kss=1 (see other parameters in depp_input/input_parameters.txt)
Goal: Evaluate boundary constraints using resampling instead of projection
Number of repetitions: 50
Average g: 23
stdev g: 4
% of failures: 12
Results: results002.xls
Conclusion: it can be seen that resampling reduced the percentage of failures compared to projection (from 30% to 12%)
