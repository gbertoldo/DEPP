!! \section Introduction
!!
!! This is the documentation of the program DEPP, which implements the Differential
!! Evolution (DE) algorithm for non-linear optimization within a rectangular domain.
!! This algorithm also contains an hybridization with the Response Surface Methodology
!! (RSM) that may accelerate the convergence. The program deals only with maximization.
!! Minimization can be taken into account by multiplying the fitness function by -1.
!! The code implementation is MPI-FORTRAN.
