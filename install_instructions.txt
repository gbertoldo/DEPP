In order to install DEPP, you must to compile DEPP's source code, that is in 'src' directory.
There is a Bash script named 'compile.sh' within src. 

Enter src/ directory 

cd src

Compile the source code by running the 'compile.sh' script

sh compile.sh

This script generates a 'depp.x' executable and moves it to ../bin/ directory. To access depp.x everywhere, add the path to DEPP's directory to your system's PATH variable. 

First enter bin/ directory

cd ../bin

and then type

echo $PWD

that will return the full path to the bin directory. Copy this path to your home direct

export PATH=$PATH:$PWD

$PWD returns the full path to the current directory.
