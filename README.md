# DEPP
Differential Evolution Parallel Program

This code implements the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm for non-linear optimization within a rectangular domain. This algorithm also contains an hybridization with the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) that may accelerate the convergence. The code implementation is MPI-FORTRAN.
